Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game written in C.

Installation
To compile and run the code, follow these steps:

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).

Clone the repository or download the source code file.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is saved.

Compile the code using the following command:

shell
Copy code
gcc -o rock_paper_scissors rock_paper_scissors.c
Run the executable:

shell
Copy code
./rock_paper_scissors
Usage
The program will prompt you to enter your choice: 3 for stone, 2 for paper, or 1 for scissors.
After you make your choice, the program will randomly generate a choice for the computer.
The program will display the results of the game: whether you won, lost, or if it's a tie.
You will then be asked if you want to stop or continue playing the game.
If you choose to continue, you can make another selection. If you choose to stop, the game will end.
